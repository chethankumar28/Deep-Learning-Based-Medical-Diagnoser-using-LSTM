# Deep-Learning-Based-Medical-Diagnoser-using-LSTM
A deep learning–based medical diagnosis system developed using TensorFlow to analyze patient symptom text and predict diseases along with recommended medications. An LSTM-based RNN architecture is used to capture contextual relationships in symptom sequences, enabling effective understanding of symptom patterns and progression from NL inputs.
