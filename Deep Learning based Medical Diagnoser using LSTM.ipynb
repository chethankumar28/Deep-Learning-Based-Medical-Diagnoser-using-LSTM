        "The rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence has opened new possibilities in the healthcare domain, especially in assisting medical diagnosis. With the help of Deep Learning, it is now possible to analyze patient symptoms and generate meaningful insights within seconds. Deep Learning models can automatically learn complex patterns from large volumes of data, making them highly effective for decision-support systems in medicine.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project focuses on developing an intelligent medical diagnosis system that predicts diseases and recommends appropriate medications based on a patient’s symptoms. Instead of relying on manual analysis, the system processes textual symptom descriptions and provides instant predictions using a trained deep learning model. Such AI-driven solutions can help improve efficiency, reduce diagnostic time, and support healthcare professionals in decision-making."

        "## Project Description\n",
        "\n",
        "In this project, a Deep Learning–based medical diagnosis model is designed and implemented using TensorFlow. The model is trained on textual data representing patient symptoms and is capable of predicting both the disease and the corresponding medication as output.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since patient symptoms are provided in the form of text sequences, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture is required to capture the contextual relationship between words. To achieve this, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is used. LSTM models are well-known for their ability to remember important information from earlier parts of a sentence, making them suitable for understanding symptom progression and severity.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, symptoms such as loss of appetite followed by fatigue and muscle weakness carry more meaning when their order is preserved. The LSTM layer effectively learns these sequential dependencies to improve prediction accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset used for training includes three key components:\n",
        "* Patient Symptoms: Text-based descriptions of medical issues\n",
        "* Diseases: Diagnosed medical conditions\n",
        "* Medications: Prescribed treatments for each condition\n",
        "\n",
        "The model architecture consists of an embedding layer for text representation, followed by an LSTM layer for sequence learning. The learned features are then passed to two separate dense output layers—one for disease classification and another for medication recommendation. This multi-output approach allows the system to provide complete diagnostic assistance in a single prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, this project demonstrates the practical application of Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing in healthcare, showcasing how AI can be leveraged to build efficient and intelligent medical support systems."
